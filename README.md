### 🛡️ Enterprise SOC / SIEM Detection Lab | 2025
Engineered a fully virtualized SOC environment integrating Splunk and ELK for centralized logging and incident response. Simulated real-world attacks including malware, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and data exfiltration while developing tuned detection logic mapped to MITRE ATT&CK.

**Impact:** Highlights strong detection engineering ability and operational understanding of security monitoring.  
**Tech:** Splunk • ELK • Kali Linux • Windows • REMnux  

---

### 🔐 Crypto Platform Security Assessment | 2025
Performed a comprehensive OWASP-aligned security assessment, identifying critical vulnerabilities and integrating Secure SDLC practices. Strengthened API protections through HTTPS enforcement, access controls, rate limiting, and container scanning with Trivy.

**Impact:** Showcases the ability to translate vulnerabilities into actionable remediation strategies.  

---

### 🌐 Secure Perimeter Network Architecture | 2024
Redesigned enterprise network segmentation with DMZ architecture, enforced firewall policies, implemented VPN-secured access, and centralized logs using ELK with Filebeat.

**Impact:** Reflects practical expertise in reducing attack surfaces and strengthening infrastructure defenses.  

---

### 📊 Compliance, Enterprise Hardening & Cloud Security | 2024
Led a structured security uplift across Windows, macOS, and Linux environments aligned with NIST SP 800-53 and CMMC standards. Established cloud build standards and improved posture using CASB-driven controls.

**Impact:** Demonstrates strong governance, risk, and compliance awareness alongside enterprise security execution.
