## Security Engineering Experience

### AI-Driven Hybrid Intrusion Detection & Prevention System | Jul 2025
Developed an advanced intrusion detection and prevention platform leveraging CNN + BiLSTM models for high-accuracy attack detection, GANs for zero-day threat simulation, and SHAP-based explainability to enhance alert transparency. Implemented edge-cloud deployment with real-time prevention capabilities and built a SOC dashboard for alert visualization, automated response, and incident management.

Demonstrates practical application of machine learning within security operations to build intelligent, production-style detection systems.

### Enterprise SOC / SIEM Detection Lab | Jan 2025
Built and operated a fully virtualized SOC environment using Kali Linux, Windows, REMnux, and VirtualBox. Deployed ELK Stack and Splunk for centralized log analysis and incident response, simulated real-world attacks including brute force, malware, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and data exfiltration, and engineered detection logic for each scenario. Tuned alerts, mapped incidents to MITRE ATT&CK, and documented response workflows.

Showcases hands-on detection engineering skills and practical experience building enterprise-style monitoring infrastructure.
