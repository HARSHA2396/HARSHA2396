## Security Engineering Experience

### AI-Driven Hybrid Intrusion Detection & Prevention System | 2025
Engineered an intelligent intrusion detection platform leveraging CNN + BiLSTM for high-accuracy attack detection, GAN-based zero-day simulation, and SHAP-driven explainability. Deployed an edge-cloud architecture with real-time prevention and a SOC dashboard for automated response.

**Impact:** Applied machine learning to build production-style detection capabilities.

---

### Enterprise SOC / SIEM Detection Lab | 2025
Built a fully virtualized SOC integrating Splunk and ELK for centralized logging and incident response. Simulated malware, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and data exfiltration while developing tuned detections mapped to MITRE ATT&CK.

**Impact:** Demonstrates operational detection engineering capability.

---

### Crypto Platform Security Assessment | 2025
Performed an OWASP-aligned security assessment, identifying critical vulnerabilities and integrating Secure SDLC practices. Hardened APIs through HTTPS enforcement, access controls, rate limiting, and container scanning.

**Impact:** Translated vulnerabilities into actionable remediation.

---

### Secure Perimeter Network Architecture | 2024
Redesigned network segmentation with DMZ architecture, enforced firewall policies, implemented VPN-secured access, and centralized logs for continuous monitoring.

**Impact:** Reduced attack surface and strengthened infrastructure defenses.

---

### Compliance, Enterprise Hardening & Cloud Security | 2024
Led a security uplift across Windows, macOS, and Linux aligned with NIST SP 800-53 and CMMC standards. Established cloud build standards and enhanced posture using CASB controls.

**Impact:** Improved enterprise security readiness and compliance posture.
